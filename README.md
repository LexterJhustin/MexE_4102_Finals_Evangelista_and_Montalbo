## Introduction
- Datasets for bird species are crucial to biodiversity studies and development of computer vision models for species identification and monitoring of their ecological status.
- Converting bird species images to grayscale removes color information, compelling models to rely solely on structural features such as texture, shape, and patterns for classification.
- This problem addresses the robustness and adaptability of computer vision models in scenarios where color data is unavailable or unreliable

## Abstract
